UserApp is the first project I've made a frontend for. It's mostly just learning about React.

# Backend
DB: SqlLite
ORM: EntityFramework
REST Service: ASP.NET Core Minimal API
Documentation: Swagger

# FrontEnd
JS Framework: React
Component Library: Material UI
HTTP Requests: Axios

In order to run it, the backend and frontend projects need to be started. Doc for doing so can be found in each project in their READMEs.
